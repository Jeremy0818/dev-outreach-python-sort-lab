Sorting histogram in python for selected sorts

**Topic and Learning Outcome:**

Iterative Algorithms:
<http://www.learnalberta.ca/ProgramOfStudy.aspx?lang=en&ProgramId=74838#900020>

**Essential Question:**

What are sorting algorithms and how can we evaluate efficiencies for these
algorithms?

**Objectives:**

Allow students to access sorting algorithms to test different use cases for
timed runs. This will allow us to compare and contrast algorithm structure as
well as algorithm efficiency.

**Prior Knowledge:**

Procedural (functional or method-driven) Programming.

Data Structures (static, dynamic and multidimensional).

**Scaffolded Practice:**

Review data structures.

Discuss random vs. almost sorted vs. reverse sorted as average, best and worst
case scenarios.

Introduce algorithms 1 by 1 to understand the pattern associated with each
sorting algorithm. This requires specifying print statements within the
algorithms that normally would not be there so review where and why.

Possibly modify code to move away from ration histogram to absolute for certain
cases to better understand the scale of difference.
